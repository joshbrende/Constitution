## Local development with Docker (Laravel Sail)

This project is configured to run in Docker using Sail with:

- `laravel.test` (PHP 8.4 runtime)
- `mysql:8.4`
- `redis:alpine`

### First-time setup

1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows and start it.
2. Open terminal in `backend`.
3. Copy Docker env file:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.docker .env -Force
```

4. Install PHP dependencies (if needed for `vendor/bin/sail`):

```powershell
composer install
```

5. Start containers:

```powershell
.\vendor\bin\sail up -d
```

6. Generate app key and migrate:

```powershell
.\vendor\bin\sail artisan key:generate
.\vendor\bin\sail artisan migrate
```

### Daily start / stop

```powershell
.\vendor\bin\sail up -d
.\vendor\bin\sail down
```

### Test commands

```powershell
.\vendor\bin\sail artisan test
.\vendor\bin\sail artisan tinker --execute="dump(DB::select('SELECT 1 as ok'));"
```

Or without Sail (same command the Linux CI job runs; `phpunit.xml` uses in-memory SQLite):

```powershell
php artisan test
```

On **Windows + WAMP**, the default `php` on PATH is often **8.1** while `composer.json` requires **PHP ^8.2**. Either switch WAMP to PHP 8.2+, set `PHP_BINARY` to that `php.exe`, or use:

```powershell
.\run-tests.ps1
```

**Docker (matches many local setups, including bind-mount quirks):**

```powershell
docker compose run --rm laravel.test php artisan test
```

**Continuous integration:** pushes and pull requests that touch `backend/` run PHPUnit on GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` at the repo root). Initialise Git in the project root and push to GitHub to enable it.

### Service ports

- App: `http://localhost:8080`
- MySQL (host): `127.0.0.1:3307`
- Redis (host): `127.0.0.1:6380`

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
